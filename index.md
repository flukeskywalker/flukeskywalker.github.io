# Rupesh Kumar Srivastava

I am a researcher in Artificial Intelligence, interested in learning algorithms <span style="color:gray">(algorithms for learning from data)</span> & learning *algorithms* <span style="color:gray">(the idea that instead of designing algorithms, we should be learning them)</span>. A list of my publications can be found [on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vTWuk1gAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Bio

Currently I am a Senior Research Scientist at [NNAISENSE](https://www.nnaisense.com). I was one of the first employees at the company, and also play various other roles including managing the software infrastructure team.

I did my PhD research at [the Swiss AI lab IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/) / [USI](https://www.inf.usi.ch/en) in [Lugano, Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugano) supervised by [JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/).
In my dissertation titled [New Architectures for Very Deep Learning](https://doc.rero.ch/record/322586), I developed a machine learning model called **Highway Networks** that enabled the training of very deep networks for the first time. Variants of this network architecture are now widely used in academia and industry.

During an internship at Microsoft Research in 2015, I was part of the team that developed and published one of the first [neural networks based image captioning systems](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2015/html/Fang_From_Captions_to_2015_CVPR_paper.html). Our team tied (with Google) for the First place at the COCO [Image Captioning Challenge in 2015](https://cocodataset.org/#captions-2015). 

I obtained a Bachelors and Masters in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).
My Masters thesis was on using evolutionary algorithms for reliable design optimization, supervised by [Kalyanmoy Deb](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~kdeb/).
During my Bachelors I played an early role in project planning and design on [Jugnu](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/j/jugnu), India's first nanosatellite.
Jugnu was launched on 12 October 2011 into low Earth orbit by ISRO using a PSLV-CA C18.
